Hi there, my friends and guests at my GH! This is my own pet project calculating
sizes of car tyres and differences between them. It's written on vanilla JS and
will be periodically modified and upgraded - i will add some new features,
styles etc.

Upd. 2022-10-29 Hello folks! First serious update - and now you can also count
disk sizes, not only tyres!) Thinking about next features...))
